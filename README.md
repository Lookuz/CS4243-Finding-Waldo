`.xml` and `.jpg` files are not included. To run the notebook you need to add all original `datasets/Annotations` and `datasets/JPEGImages`. (But don't cover the two json files I put in `datasets/Annotations`, they should remain there)
Python 3.7.3 is used. `requirements.txt` has been updated to the environment.
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/ is used for annotation.
